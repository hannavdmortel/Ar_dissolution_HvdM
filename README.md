This repository includes the raw data and scripts used to analyze and plot this data for the study:
 
### 'Laboratory Observation of the Galvanizing Effect of Aragonite Dissolution at the Seafloor'

H. van de Mortel, L. Delaigue, M. P. Humphreys, J. J. Middelburg, G.-J. A. Brummer, S. Ossebaar, K. Bakker, J. P. Trabucho Alexandre, A. W. E. van Leeuwen-Tolboom and O. Sulpis


There are three main folders:

### Method
- Includes data for the respiration test in Excel, the Python script to plot this data and the figures.

### Experiment 1
- Includes pH microprofile data of both cuvettes A (with pteropods) and B (without pteropods) in Excel, the script to plot these in Python, the associated figure and a script to compute the saturation states in Python. 
- Includes RADI model MATLAB scripts, the Excel file with output data of the model, Python scripts to plot these profiles,  Python script to plot the reaction rates in relation to those of the RADIv1 paper (Sulpis et al., 2022) as well as the associated figures.  
- Includes XRD data in Excel. 

### Experiment 2
- Includes data for the rotating disk reactor (RDR) pH profiles in Excel, the scripts to plot this in Python and figures.
- Includes Python script to calculate and then plot the dissolution rate and degree of undersaturation for each stage in the RDR experiment, as well as the associated figure.
